## Introduction

In January 2020, a single infected traveler on a long-haul flight could spark an outbreak thousands of kilometers away—turning global aviation into a high-speed conveyor belt for COVID-19. Indeed, early analyses demonstrated that aviation can rapidly reduce effective distances between cities, accelerating worldwide transmission [@chinazzi2020; @sun2022_a]. At the same time, countries exhibited **large variability in excess mortality**, often shaped by **demographic** (e.g., population age, life expectancy) and **economic** (e.g., GDP, healthcare capacity) factors. For instance, [@rahmanian2024] identified government effectiveness, vaccination coverage, and population age structure as key drivers of cross-national differences in pandemic mortality across 21 countries. Similarly, [@matveeva2023] noted that lower GDP per capita and slower vaccination rates were correlated with higher excess mortality among European nations, reflecting a synergistic effect of vaccination coverage and broader healthcare resources on reducing COVID-19–associated deaths.

A less investigated aspect, however, is **epidemic arrival time**: Did countries “hit first” by the virus—when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) were still immature—face worse overall mortality outcomes? This project aims to explore how early seeding of COVID-19 might have compounded the effects of the aforementioned demographic and economic predictors, ultimately shaping cross-national excess mortality patterns.

As outlined in the Z_GIS Thesis Blog by [@neuwirth2024], the **hypothesis** states that **locations hit early and unprepared** faced more severe outbreaks, characterized by:

- **Longer durations** without access to vaccination  
- **Lack of effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)** during early waves  
- **Additional outbreak risks** (e.g., secondary winter waves before vaccination was available)  

Accordingly, **early epidemic arrival** is expected to correlate with **higher prevalence, reproduction rates, and excess mortality** at the national level.  

To test this hypothesis, the initial approach suggested by [@neuwirth2024] (which I will evaluate and refine in subsequent sections) followed five key steps:

1. **Construct a Global Mobility Network (GMN)** using worldwide air travel data from early 2020 (**OpenSky COVID-19 Flight Dataset and/or FlightRadar24 API**) to represent the situation at the outbreak’s onset.  
2. **Implement a SIR network simulation model** as presented by [@brockmann2013].  
3. **Run outbreak simulations** (seeding in Wuhan) to estimate **arrival times (ranks)** of the epidemic in different regions.  
4. **Validate the model** by comparing simulated epidemic arrivals with reported data.
5. **Correlate modeled epidemic arrivals with reported excess mortality**, assessing the impact of arrival timing on overall mortality outcomes.

*However, initial evaluation of data sources reveals several practical and methodological challenges, potentially limiting the feasibility of a fully global analysis. I will address these issues and propose methodological refinements in subsequent sections.*

## Data Feasibility and Coverage

This section outlines my evaluation of publicly accessible aviation data sources, with the aim of assessing whether a global SIR model based on air travel is realistically implementable within the scope of a bachelor’s thesis. The findings justify a Europe-focused network as the most feasible and methodologically sound approach.

Although the initial approach proposed by [@neuwirth2024] emphasizes a global-scale simulation using OpenSky or FlightRadar24, preliminary explorations and data evaluations have revealed substantial feasibility challenges. This section addresses key limitations encountered, particularly regarding data accessibility, coverage issues, and practical modeling constraints.

Specifically, crowdsourced ADS-B datasets such as OpenSky present significant coverage gaps in critical regions like China, especially during the early months of the pandemic (e.g., February 2020). Conversely, high-quality commercial datasets such as Eurocontrol, while robust, provide only limited temporal coverage (four discrete months per year), complicating continuous epidemic modeling.

    missing_origin = sum(is.na(origin)),

  )

china_to_europe_flights <- df_cleaned %>%
  filter(origin %in% china_airports & destination %in% europe_airports)

cat("Total flights from China to Eurocontrol zone:", nrow(china_to_europe_flights), "\n")

```

To overcome these limitations, I propose integrating multiple complementary data sources. Specifically, the OpenSky dataset from February 2020—despite its limited volume (only 674 direct flights China-Eurocontrol Zone Members)—will serve as a critical baseline for the early epidemic arrival phase. Eurocontrol data (starting March 2020), offering comprehensive European flight records, will help normalize and validate February's flight numbers. For months lacking explicit records, linear interpolation and seasonal normalization methods will be employed. Furthermore, considering early travel restrictions in China (e.g., Wuhan’s lockdown on stated [here](#wavetime)), additional major international transit hubs such as Dubai, Doha, and Singapore will be incorporated as secondary seed locations, reflecting a more realistic scenario of initial COVID-19 dissemination into Europe.

### Crowdsourced ADS-B: Strengths and Weaknesses

Multiple studies have leveraged crowdsourced ADS-B data for COVID-19 mobility analyses [@suzumura2020; @iacus2020; @salgas2024], yet coverage remains heavily biased toward North America and Europe. For instance, @suzumura2020 analyzed ~1.9 million flights (1 January–30 April 2020) from OpenSky’s dataset but noted minimal representation of flights into or out of China. By contrast, @strohmeier2021 reports that OpenSky recorded 30,989,481 flights in 2019—roughly 45% of all global flights that year—still undercounting major regions such as China, Africa, and parts of Asia. Consequently, reconstructing Wuhan-based travel for early 2020 remains particularly challenging:

> “OpenSky Network [...] does not provide global coverage and [...] flight data for major global airports such as the Beijing Capital International Airport in China and the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Indonesia are not available.” [@iacus2020]

Such large discrepancies between partial flight samples (@suzumura2020 early 2020 subset) and near-full annual coverage (@strohmeier2021 2019 totals) underscore the network’s highly uneven global sensor distribution. While some countries enjoy excellent receiver density, enabling robust analysis, large swaths of Asia and Africa have insufficient coverage. This unevenness must be accounted for in any study that relies on ADS-B data for measuring pandemic-related changes in global air travel. Alternatives mentioned below may help to mitigate these gaps, either by incorporating proprietary datasets (OAG/IATA), leveraging regional traffic records, or exploring hybrid machine-learning approaches using open data.

*Given these coverage biases, researchers often look beyond crowdsourced ADS-B to fill critical data gaps, as discussed next.*

### Proprietary Data and Regional Sources

Given the substantial coverage gaps identified with crowdsourced ADS-B sources, especially concerning early 2020 flights originating in China, researchers often turn to proprietary or regional data providers as more comprehensive alternatives. For instance, the **FlightRadar24 (FR24)** platform, highlighted by @neuwirth2024, offers extensive aviation data through a commercial ADS-B and multilateration network. @quadros2022 successfully utilized FR24 data to compile global civil aviation emissions between 2017 and 2020, demonstrating the potential for capturing diverse flight types—including cargo and unscheduled flights—that traditional schedule-only databases (such as OAG) might omit.

However, FR24 data are also subject to notable constraints:

- Coverage remains uneven, particularly for periods prior to 2020 and in regions such as Asia and Africa [@quadros2022].
- Data retrieval involves significant computational overhead, as large-scale queries for historical flight positions require substantial processing resources.
- Cost constraints pose a major barrier. FR24 employs a subscription-based, credit-driven pricing structure:
  - **Essential tier:** $90/month, offering 333,000 monthly credits and 2-year historical access.
  - **Advanced tier:** $900/month, providing 4,050,000 credits and unlimited historical access (subject to system limitations).

While comprehensive commercial databases (e.g., OAG or IATA) are available and offer near-complete coverage of scheduled flights and passenger flows, they are similarly subscription-based and costly, limiting accessibility primarily to well-funded research projects [@chinazzi2020]. As a result, many researchers adopt a regional approach, using datasets like **Eurocontrol** (Europe) or **FAA** (U.S.).

Considering these factors, a preliminary exploration of both Eurocontrol and OpenSky datasets was conducted. While OpenSky data from February 2020 included only **674 flights from China to Europe as previously stated.**, Eurocontrol’s data, although comprehensive for specific months (e.g., March, June, August, December), lacked crucial coverage for February 2020—the critical early period of COVID-19’s initial spread to Europe (first detected in France). To address these limitations, a hybrid data integration approach—combining Eurocontrol’s monthly snapshots with OpenSky’s February data—was assessed. This approach would necessitate interpolation of missing monthly flight counts and normalization across datasets, ensuring temporal continuity and data consistency for modeling.

Given the resource-intensity, uneven coverage, and potential analytical limitations posed by global proprietary data, this thesis will adopt a Europe-focused regional approach. By leveraging Eurocontrol’s detailed datasets, supplemented and temporally harmonized with OpenSky data for missing intervals (e.g., February 2020), the analysis will achieve sufficient spatial-temporal granularity to robustly model the early epidemic spread into Europe.

### ADS-B Exchange Archives

**ADS-B Exchange** offers **high-resolution (5-second interval)** global flight data from **March 2020 onward**. Although this represents an improvement over other open sources, critical coverage gaps persist, especially for **mainland China and specifically Wuhan**, significantly limiting its usefulness for capturing the pandemic's initial spread phase [@salgas2024]. Since the primary research question of this thesis concerns the early months of 2020 (January and February), ADS-B Exchange cannot adequately fill these crucial temporal gaps.

*Thus, despite its detailed nature, the post-March 2020 coverage of ADS-B Exchange is insufficient to study the earliest phases of COVID-19 transmission relevant to this research.*

### A Different Approach: Wikipedia + XGBoost

A promising open-data alternative to overcome gaps in aviation datasets has been recently proposed by [@salgas2024]. Their method merges **Wikipedia-scraped airport route data** with **XGBoost-based seat-capacity estimations**, providing a novel way to impute missing flight connections. Although originally applied to **2019 data**, this approach theoretically could be extended to early 2020 using historical Wikipedia snapshots (e.g., via the Internet Archive).

However, as emphasized by @salgas2024, this method requires substantial effort, including:

- manual Wikipedia data extraction,
- significant data cleaning,
- iterative training and validation of the machine learning model, and
- careful integration with radar-based or administrative flight records.

These processes are described as **"long and complex"** and yield results primarily suitable for **aggregated analyses at national or continental levels**, rather than precise route-level accuracy. Given the practical scope and limited available hours (~300 hours) for this bachelor's thesis, adopting this full-scale Wikipedia + XGBoost pipeline would exceed project constraints. Therefore, while innovative and valuable for future research endeavors requiring comprehensive global data, this approach is considered beyond the feasible scope of the current thesis.

*Thus, despite its methodological innovation, the Wikipedia + XGBoost strategy is judged impractical for this project's timeframe and resource constraints.*

### Seats vs. Actual Passengers

Another notable methodological challenge arises from the discrepancy between available data (typically seat capacities) and actual passenger numbers. Most **open-source flight datasets** (e.g., OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange) lack explicit passenger information, leading researchers to estimate traveler numbers by applying **assumed passenger load factors (PLF)** to seat capacities.

Pre-pandemic, the global PLF reached a record **82.6% in 2019** [@IATA2020], yet dropped sharply to **65.2% in 2020** due to COVID-19 [@Statista2024]. This rapid decline introduced additional uncertainty into passenger-flow estimates. The main inaccuracies include:

- **Cargo flights misidentified as passenger flights**: Unlabeled cargo-only operations may mistakenly inflate passenger estimates if treated as passenger flights [@suzumura2020].
- **Reduced occupancy and ghost flights**: Many flights operated near-empty to maintain airport slots or for regulatory purposes [@sun2022_b], complicating the reliability of simple PLF approximations.

*Given the data availability constraints, the common practice of multiplying seat capacities by historical or assumed PLFs remains necessary, despite acknowledging these inherent limitations. This thesis explicitly recognizes potential inaccuracies and will incorporate sensitivity analyses on these load-factor assumptions where feasible.*

### Are Passengers “Isolated” in Transit? How Does This Affect the Model?

A further simplification inherent to large-scale network models, such as the **SIR** model presented by [@brockmann2013], involves treating air travel as instantaneous transmission events:

- **No in-flight quarantine or detailed cabin modeling**: Passengers are not considered isolated during flights; the model effectively assumes immediate infection potential upon arrival.
- **Ignored intra-cabin transmission**: While cabin-specific airflow and seating arrangements can influence in-flight transmission [@wang2023], these micro-level factors are typically omitted in macro-scale epidemic models due to computational and data complexity.

Thus, flights function primarily as **network links facilitating long-distance virus introductions**, rather than detailed sites of infection dynamics.

**In conclusion**, given these significant limitations with existing open (ADS-B Exchange, Wikipedia + XGBoost) and proprietary datasets (FR24, OAG/IATA), the initial global epidemic modeling proposal is pragmatically refined into a regional, Europe-centric approach. Leveraging robust Eurocontrol datasets supplemented by strategically selected OpenSky records, this thesis employs careful temporal interpolation, normalization, and sensitivity analyses. This adapted methodology aligns realistically with available resources, ensuring robust and feasible analysis of how early epidemic arrival influenced excess mortality across European nations.

**The next section** outlines the practical implementation steps of integrating this refined data strategy within a network-based SIR epidemic modeling framework.

## Rationale and Potential Approaches for Future Research

### Regional vs. Global Scope

Given the substantial limitations of available aviation data, a key methodological decision revolves around selecting an appropriate geographic scope. A **global approach**, while appealing due to its comprehensiveness, faces significant data challenges, particularly in regions with poor ADS-B coverage, such as China, Southeast Asia, and Africa [@suzumura2020; @iacus2020]. To mitigate these coverage gaps, one could employ methods such as Wikipedia scraping combined with XGBoost-based seat-capacity estimations to partially fill data voids [@salgas2024]. However, as previously highlighted, such an approach involves substantial labor overhead and complexity, making it less suitable for short-term projects.

In contrast, adopting a **regional scope**, particularly **Europe**, offers several distinct advantages:

- **Robust data availability** through the Eurocontrol network, which provides detailed flight records within Europe.
- Greater methodological reliability, as Europe’s aviation patterns are consistently captured by multiple data sources (e.g., Eurocontrol complemented by OpenSky).
- Practical alignment with project constraints (~300 hours available), allowing for thorough and well-founded analysis without sacrificing accuracy.

Moreover, intra-country transmission dynamics also play a significant role in epidemic spread. For instance, @laroze2020 showed that domestic commuting patterns significantly influenced COVID-19’s progression within English districts. A Europe-centric modeling approach thus presents an opportunity to incorporate not only international but potentially domestic and subregional mobility patterns as well, thereby capturing a more realistic spread scenario within manageable data requirements.

Given these considerations, **this thesis adopts a Europe-centric network approach**, enabling precise analysis of epidemic arrival timing and its subsequent impact on national-level excess mortality. The next sections will detail the methodological steps taken to integrate these European flight data into a network-based epidemic simulation.

### SIR as a Model Implementation

The thesis employs a **network-based SIR model**, as originally presented by [@brockmann2013], to simulate the initial epidemic spread through aviation networks. Although ideally Wuhan airport would serve as the starting node (initial seeding), early data limitations make it necessary to consider alternative major Chinese airports (e.g., Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen) as proxies, especially given Wuhan's travel restrictions beginning 23 January 2020 [@chinazzi2020]. This approach aligns with previous studies highlighting the central role of major international hubs in early global dissemination [@lai2020].

A more sophisticated modeling choice would involve using a compartmental **SEIR** (or multi-stage **SEnIR**) approach, capturing a more realistic incubation period distribution (Gamma-like) and enhancing epidemiological accuracy [@abou2020; @rozan2024]. Such models provide nuanced insights into epidemic peaks, spread timing, and infection dynamics. However, they require additional parameters, detailed calibration, and more extensive computational resources, often demanding agent-based or fine-grained simulations.

Given this thesis’s resource constraints, the simpler **SIR formulation**—using a mean-rate approximation of incubation and recovery periods as suggested by [@brockmann2013]—is methodologically sufficient to estimate initial arrival ranks of the epidemic across Europe. Nevertheless, future extensions of this work could explore implementing the more detailed **SEnIR** approach, particularly for studies aiming to examine secondary waves, detailed transmission dynamics, or public health interventions over longer time frames.

## Specified Data

Many providers of flight movement data (e.g., FR24, OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange) rely heavily on **crowdsourced ADS-B** signals, leading to uneven coverage and potential biases in regions with fewer ADS-B receivers. In contrast, **Eurocontrol** gathers **flight plans and updates for all IFR** (Instrument Flight Rules) flights within European airspace, integrating radar data and other Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) sources to offer a centralized, **operationally verified** overview.

### Access & Terms of Service

- Eurocontrol grants access via an **R&D Platform** exclusively for **non-commercial research**, requiring **user registration** and acceptance of their Terms of Service (TOS).
- While **raw ATM data** sharing is prohibited, researchers can publicly disseminate **aggregated or derived** insights (e.g., charts, maps, diagrams) provided Eurocontrol is appropriately **credited**.
- For this thesis, I obtained **personal access** under strict adherence to these research-focused guidelines.

### Data Availability & Format

- Eurocontrol’s dataset covers **four snapshot months per year**: March, June, September, and December.
- It includes **commercial flights only** (types `S` for scheduled and `N` for non-scheduled), excluding general aviation and military operations.
- Detailed flight-level information comprises scheduled and actual departure/arrival times, aircraft type (ICAO 8643), operator details (ICAO 8585), route waypoints, and airspace specifics, updated each AIRAC cycle.
- Given the limited temporal coverage (four months annually), supplementary sources (e.g., **OpenSky**) will help fill critical temporal gaps.

**Metadata & TOS:** Further details available via the [EUROCONTROL ATM R&D Datasets – Terms of Use](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/eurocontrol-atm-rd-datasets-terms-use). All data handling complies with **non-commercial research use**, restricting public dissemination of raw flight records.

### Combining with OpenSky

To bridge temporal gaps between the quarterly Eurocontrol snapshots, the thesis leverages the **OpenSky Network** dataset ("Crowdsourced air traffic data from The OpenSky Network 2020," @olive2023). Despite known coverage limitations, particularly in regions like China or Africa, OpenSky’s **continuous monthly data** provides essential continuity, enabling coherent modeling of air traffic trends preceding and following Eurocontrol snapshots.

### Modeling Europe’s Initial COVID-19 Wave and Time Windows {#wavetime}

While isolated COVID-19 cases likely appeared in Europe as early as **December 2019** (Deslandes et al., 2020) REF!, significant viral seeding events are believed to have predominantly occurred through air travel from China between **January and February 2020** (@chinazzi2020). Gradual travel restrictions emerged over this period:

- **23 January 2020:** Wuhan city enforced an internal lockdown, yet international travel continued, allowing asymptomatic or undetected carriers to reach global aviation hubs. As highlighted by Chinazzi et al. (2020), the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days within mainland China but significantly reduced international case importations by nearly 80% until mid-February.
- **Late January–Early February 2020:** Several countries (e.g., the U.S., Australia) introduced travel bans on direct flights from China (SOURCE!), though indirect transit via global hubs remained available. (WHICH ONES? SOURCE!)
- **March 2020:** Comprehensive lockdown measures across Europe dramatically curtailed flight volumes, but significant viral entry had already occurred by this stage.
- **8 April 2020:** After approximately 10 weeks of strict lockdown measures, Wuhan resumed air and train services, further emphasizing the critical role global aviation hubs played in epidemic dispersion (@zhang2020a).

Given Eurocontrol’s quarterly data availability, the thesis strategically integrates datasets:

- **OpenSky (January–February, April–May 2020):**
  - Offers continuous coverage of incoming European flights, capturing early indirect transmissions through key transit hubs.
  - Documents evolving air mobility patterns as lockdowns commenced.

- **Eurocontrol (March & June 2020):**
  - Provides detailed flight data just as lockdown measures intensified (March), and again during the initial easing of restrictions (June).
  - Enables clear comparative analyses to evaluate the impact of mitigation measures.

### Correlation with Excess Mortality

After simulating epidemic arrival timing in European countries using the adjusted SIR model, these predictions will be correlated specifically with national-level excess mortality rates to quantify whether early epidemic seeding systematically influenced mortality outcomes (@sun2022; @chinazzi2020).

A recent short communication by Neuwirth & Elixhauser (202x, in preparation) compiles global excess mortality data but explicitly highlights that the most comprehensive and consistently measured datasets—including excess mortality alongside key socioeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP, healthcare quality, vaccination rates)—are predominantly available for European countries. Thus, despite the broader global intent of their dataset, the density and reliability of European data specifically justify the focused analysis undertaken here.

Although incorporating additional socioeconomic factors would enrich the analysis, such an approach exceeds the scope and time constraints of this thesis. Nevertheless, the proposed Europe-focused correlation offers meaningful insights into how epidemic arrival timing may have impacted national mortality outcomes, contributing to a deeper understanding of early COVID-19 pandemic dynamics.

## Advanced Research Question & Hypothesis

**Research Question**  
> Does the timing of epidemic seeding—derived from integrated air traffic data (OpenSky for January–February and April–May, and Eurocontrol for March and June 2020)—correlate with higher excess mortality in Europe during the first wave of COVID-19?

**Hypothesis**  
We hypothesize that **countries experiencing earlier epidemic seeding**, as inferred from our integrated flight network analysis (January–June 2020), will exhibit **higher first-wave excess mortality**. Although controlling for additional socioeconomic factors would strengthen the analysis, this thesis explicitly focuses on the direct relationship between epidemic arrival timing and mortality, acknowledging socioeconomic elements as important but beyond the immediate scope.

The anticipated mechanism driving this relationship includes:

- **Shorter reaction times for interventions:**  
  Countries seeded earlier had less opportunity to implement timely non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), potentially leading to more rapid spread and higher mortality.

- **Increased strain on healthcare systems:**  
  Early epidemic waves could overwhelm healthcare resources, exacerbating mortality rates.

- **Heightened exposure through international hubs:**  
  Major airports (e.g., Frankfurt, Paris, London) potentially acted as primary gateways for viral entry, rapidly amplifying epidemic spread into densely populated regions.

By integrating OpenSky and Eurocontrol data, our Europe-centric model will effectively capture the key patterns and timing of epidemic seeding events, allowing for a meaningful analysis of their potential correlation with excess mortality.

### Research Design and Methodology

In line with my **Supervisor’s advice (March 14, 2025)**, this thesis will **avoid complex agent-based modeling (ABM)** in favor of a simplified network-based **SIR model** inspired by [@brockmann2013]. This streamlined approach is justified by:

- **Feasibility:** Avoids excessive complexity, aligning with the limited scope and timeline of a bachelor’s thesis.
- **Aggregated Flows:** Airports (and ultimately countries) are represented as **nodes**, with aggregated passenger flows as edges, maintaining manageable data complexity.
- **Preservation of Core Dynamics:** Captures critical aspects needed to investigate epidemic seeding patterns and mortality relationships without intricate individual-level modeling.

### Specific Methodological Steps

1. **Construct a Europe-Centric Global Mobility Network (GMN)**
   - Prioritize European airports based on data coverage (Eurocontrol/OpenSky), emphasizing major hubs (e.g., Paris, London, Frankfurt) to capture significant passenger volumes.
   - Aggregate daily passenger flows (seat capacity × assumed load factor) between airports.
   - **Visualization:** Create simplified yet illustrative airport-level visualizations (e.g., Sankey diagrams). For statistical analyses, aggregate flows to country level.

2. **Implement a Simplified ODE-Based SIR Model**
   - Represent each airport as a node, modeling daily changes in SIR compartments.
   - Instead of relying solely on Wuhan-specific flights, use data from multiple major Chinese airports (e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen) to approximate early European epidemic seeding. This decision aligns with established evidence showing significant international case exportation from these hubs following Wuhan’s travel restrictions on January 23, 2020 (@chinazzi2020; @zhang2020a).

3. **Estimate Country-Level Epidemic Arrival Times**
   - Define arrival time as the day an airport surpasses a predefined infection threshold.
   - Aggregate airport-level arrival estimates to generate a country-level epidemic arrival timeline.

4. **Rank Countries by Estimated Epidemic Arrival**
   - Rank countries according to the earliest estimated epidemic arrival date derived from simulations, reflecting their relative position in the seeding timeline.

5. **Correlation with Excess Mortality**
   - Correlate estimated arrival times with national-level excess mortality data to examine whether early epidemic seeding systematically relates to mortality outcomes.
   - Explicitly exclude extensive socioeconomic variables from this initial correlation analysis, clearly noting this limitation.

Important Paper to note: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X22002207](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X22002207)

- Maybe need to dtone it down a bit.. but shwocase. that Wuhan solely is NOT the right way to go.
